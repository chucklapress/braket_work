also of note much of the code base and learning came from

Other really good things I found to learn with  
[Medium article on gates](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-quantum-gates-one-qubit-at-a-time-54404ed80640)  

Utilizing the notebook you can run your gate learning exercises from this helpful doc

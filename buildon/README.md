#### Toonie Toss Quantum  

Fun little one of program, this uses a single Qubit and applies a Hadamard gate to provide a uniform superposed state.  

The number of shots provide a equal chance of the Qubit measuring in the 0 or 1 state making for a perfect 50/50 likelihood of your coin toss being fair and random.  

Of course we can modify this script by not running on the local simulator, but on actual hardware but this script is for fun.  

#### adding a screen capture of the results run in a Jupyter notebook inside Amazon Braket service

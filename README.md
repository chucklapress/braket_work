# AWS Braket Quantum code

As I experiment and work through learning, I'll be saving code that I can execute in the Jupyter notebooks

## Beginning steps

Follow this beginner-step guideline at this link  
[AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-run-circuit.html)

## Usage

```python
# follow the steps outlined in the python code  
"""
Go through step by step in Jupyter paying attention
to what the lines of commented code are describing
and notice how when running on the rigetti quantum machine
the number of shots have to be increased and the output is expected
to be placed in an S3 bucket named similarly to my example
"""

# a side note the AWS documents provide the base "Hello World" example run that first

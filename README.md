# AWS Braket Quantum code

As I experiment and work through learning quantum computing using AWS Braket, I'll be saving code that I can execute in the Jupyter notebooks

## Beginning steps

Follow this beginner-step guideline at this link  
[AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-run-circuit.html)

## Usage

The code examples and links to key learning materials are encapsulated in folders  
in the repository week_1, week_2, and I hope to comeback and add new content when I do more.  

I have provided a series of screen captures to show the various tabs in AWS Braket you will be using  

### the list of simulators and real quantum devices and availability

### the interface to launch and view your managed Jupyter notebooks

### after completion the links to the tasks and run statuses

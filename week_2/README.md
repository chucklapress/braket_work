## Week two highlights  
If you are curious week two was outlined & chronicled here:  

[LinkedIn post #2](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7032569330307387392/)  
also of note much of the code base and learning came from  

[AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/introducing-the-qiskit-provider-for-amazon-braket/)  

Other really good things I found to learn with  
[Git repo for qiskit braket](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider)  
  
[Qiskit community ipynb](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider/blob/main/docs/tutorials/0_tutorial_qiskit-braket-provider_overview.ipynb)


### Usage  
Review the README at the base of the repository for a good   
starting point, and also the week one folder and try out the service in AWS  
and hopefully learn, and have fun.

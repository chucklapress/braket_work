## Week four highlights  
This is really the most basic operation of a circuit, the twist in the week  
four execution was I was curious to interact with another QPU and this one  
is located in Reading, United Kingdom operated by Oxford Quantum Circuits and named LUCY  
If you are curious week two was outlined & chronicled here:  

[Information about OQC](https://oxfordquantumcircuits.com/technology)  
a reminder the running your first circuit using the Amazon Braket Python SDK  

[AWS link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-run-circuit.html)  

Other really good things I found to learn with
